## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - IP Geolocation API
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - Leaflet API for the map
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - React Leaflet


### What I learned

I've learned how to work with Leaflet API and how to integrate it with geolocation API.


### Continued development

The project might be extended by remembering previous IP searches and showing all of them on the map.
Deleting a record on clicking on the map pin.
